             New examples added.  Check out examples/remote to see
             an example of transmitting LLVM bitcode over a network
             connection and instantiating a remote Python module.

             Fixed a bug checking LLVM magic numbers.

             Minor refactoring of the loader.  There is now a function
             build_module(fullname, bitcode, preload, postload) that
             will construct a module and return it.  This can be used
             to create a module where the bitcode is obtained through
             some other means than reading a file.  preload and
             postload are fragments of Python code to execute prior to
             and after wrapping the bitcode.

             Initial release.
