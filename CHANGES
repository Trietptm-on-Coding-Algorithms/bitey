             Fixed a bug checking LLVM magic numbers.

             Minor refactoring of the loader.  There is now a function
             build_module(fullname, bitcode, preload, postload) that
             will construct a module and drop it into sys.modules.
             This can be used to create a module where the bitcode
             is obtained through some other means than reading a file.
	     preload and postload are fragments of Python code to
             execute prior to and after wrapping the bitcode.
