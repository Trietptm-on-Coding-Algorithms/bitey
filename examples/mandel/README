Make a mandelbrot set.    This example illustrates the resulting
speedup you can get by writing code in C.  To run the example,
first just try running the mandel.py program:

    % python mandel.py
    Wrote mandel.png
    12.3137500286 seconds
    %

Now, try making the LLVM extension module and running again:

    % make
    clang -O3 -emit-llvm -c _mandel.c
    % python mandel.py
    Wrote mandel.png
    0.817422151566 seconds
    %

Your timing numbers will vary of course.

If you want to compare it to a raw ctypes version, do this:

    % make shared
    gcc -O3 -bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup _mandel.c -o _mandel.so
    % python mandel_ctypes.py
    Wrote mandel.png
    0.8027312584 seconds
    % 

You should find the performance to be comparable to the Bitey version.
